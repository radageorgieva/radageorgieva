### Hi, I am Rada Georgieva 👋

### 
I am a Data Scientist and Data Analyst working as the Nordic Analytics Manager at Procter & Gamble while completing my MSc degree in Business Analytics at Imperial College London.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Advanced Machine Learning Projects including Image Recognition, Sentiment Analysis and Network Analytics.
- 🌱 In the final semester of my MSc degree I focus on developing end-to-end Advanced Analytics solutions in various industries like the Energy, Supply Chain, Heathcare, Retail and Marketing sector.
- 📝 I have experience in leveraging Python to automate the extraction of data from complex, difficult-to-read documents, such as Invoices sent in various PDFs formats. The result is ready-to-analyze dataset used for joint business planning.
- 🥇 I am among the winners of the Vodafone Italia Big Data Challenge 2019.
- 🤓 I extract, manipulate and apply Machine Learning and Statistical models in **Python, R, SQL, Knime and Excel** and visualize insights in automated **Power BI and Tableau** dashboards.  
- 🤸 Fun Fact: My 6k a day runs are my best mood booster.
